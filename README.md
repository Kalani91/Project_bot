Now in your device open up command prompt / terminal. You can check which version of git is installed using ``` git --version ```.

Navigate to the directory where you want the project to be placed using ```cd d:/path/to/directory/```.

Use ```git clone https://github.com/Kalani91/Project_bot.git``` to clone. **You will be prompted to authenticate either through Github or username & password.** This will create a new folder that has the name of the repository, and will set up the connection so that you can push changes to the repository on Github.

All done with setup.

### Editing and making changes to code
**Note:** You should never modify files when in the ```main\master``` branch as this is considered the most stable point of the project.

Most IDE's come with source control management inbuilt which should automatically detect version control being used in project directory, makes creating branches, commiting, pushing, and pulling simpler with GUI and buttons.
